## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 18.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables. Genkit uses these to authenticate with the Google AI services.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2.  Add your Google AI API key to the `.env` file:

    ```sh
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/classroom-ai-companion.git
    cd classroom-ai-companion
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    The application uses two concurrent processes: one for the Next.js app and one for the Genkit AI flows.

    -   In your first terminal, start the Next.js app:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the web application, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

    -   In a second terminal, start the Genkit development server:
        ```sh
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This starts the Genkit flows and makes them available to the Next.js application.

4.  **Open the app:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application in action.
